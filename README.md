# Connected-Component-Labelling
A DSA project implemented in C++ using Disjoint Set data structure and Multithreading that reads a binary digital image, performs Linear Convolution and detect connected regions in it.

Connected-component labeling is used in computer vision to detect connected regions in binary digital images, although color images and data with higher dimensionality can also be processed. When integrated into an image recognition system or human-computer interaction interface, connected component labeling can operate on a variety of information.
